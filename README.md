# Neighborhood
## Neighborhood-App, 4th of November 2019
### By Aline Nicole UWAMARIYA
## Description
If you are like me, You really don’t know what is happening in your neighborhood most of the time. What if an important meeting happens, theft or even death wouldn’t you like to know about it.

Our Job is to create a web application that allows you to be in the loop about everything happening in your neighborhood. From contact information of different handyman to meeting announcements or even alerts.
## Code scaffolding
Run python3.6 manage.py runserver when you want to implement the features of the landing pages and other pages.

## BDD
### Behaviour
We want our application to:

A project can be rated based on 3 different criteria

1.Design
2.Usability
3.Content

These criteria can be reviewed on a scale of 1-10 and the average score is taken.

As a user, I would like to:

1.View posted projects and their details
2.Post a project to be rated/reviewed
3.Rate/ review other users' projects
4.Search for projects 
5.View projects overall score
6.View my profile page

## Input Examples
1.search users by title of project
2.Create a profile,registering,sign in,log in,create a post for project,rating regarding the Design,Usability and Content,etc

## Output Examples
any User will be able to see the proects he/she has posted and their description and rates, and the user may be able to search for other projects.

## TDD
I test my project using Python3.6 manage.py test insta(my app-name).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1.Your application should be accessible to users on both desktop and mobile formats. You must ensure that your application is responsive to different screen sizes.

2.Your application should have a clean, simple, well-organized user interface. Ensure you choose a consistent color scheme and use appropriate fonts for your application. Also, you MUST create a mockup design for your application before you begin development.

3.Projects should have a Title, an image of the project's landing page, a detailed description of the project, a link to the live site.

4.Your project should have a user profile that at least the following information:

a.Profile picture of the user
b.User Bio
c.Projects the user has posted
d.A contact information of the user

5.Your application should have a solid authentication system that allows users to sign up or log in to the application before posting or rating a project.

6.Projects will be rated/reviewed based on the following criteria:

a.Design - This is the overall appearance of the project
b.Usability - This can be translated to the user experience and how responsive the project is.
c.Content - This includes the technologies used, the font used(is it uniform throughout the project) and grammar.
These criteria will each be rated/review on a scale of 1-10 and the overall score will be their average.

7.You should create an API so that users can access data from your application. You can create two API endpoints:

a.Profile - This endpoint should return all the user profiles with information such as the username, bio, projects of the user and profile picture
b.Projects- This endpoint should return information pertaining to all the projects posted in your application.

8.Your project should have tests to test the core behaviours. All your tests should pass.
